## Introduction
This report investigates two critical inquiries related to global poverty dynamics and income inequality. The first question explores the conquest of extreme poverty across various global regions over time and examines the distribution of wealth among income groups. The second question delves into the influence of welfare regimes and economic growth rates on income inequality and poverty dynamics, considering different welfare types and international poverty lines. The approaches include interactive visualizations and advanced data analysis techniques to provide comprehensive insights into these complex issues.

## Overview
The global battle against poverty demands a solid foundation of reliable and comprehensive data. This project, spearheaded by Insight Architect, delves into a wealth of information on global poverty trends sourced from Our World in Data. With a vast array of indicators spanning income, education, inequality, and welfare policies, this dataset serves as a cornerstone for researchers and policymakers alike. By employing advanced data visualization tools within a shiny app in R, the project aims to shed light on the intricate dynamics of poverty across different regions and timelines. With 4,877 rows and 108 columns, the dataset offers a treasure trove of metrics including the headcount ratio at the international poverty line and Gini coefficients. These metrics are essential for dissecting poverty trends and understanding the distribution of wealth among various income groups. Throughout this research, pivotal questions surrounding the reduction of extreme poverty, wealth distribution, and the impact of welfare regimes and economic growth on income inequality will be explored. By unraveling these complexities, the project seeks to provide deeper insights into poverty alleviation efforts and economic policies implemented across global regions over the past three decades.

## Questions Addressed
### Question 1: 
Who is Conquering Extreme Poverty in Various Global Regions Across Time? How does the distribution of wealth differ among various income groups?

### Question 2:
How do welfare regimes and economic growth rates influence income inequality and poverty dynamics across different countries and continents over the last three decades, influenced by varying welfare types and international poverty lines, and what implications do these interactions have for future global poverty reduction strategies?

## Data Sources and Tools
The analysis is conducted using R programming language, leveraging interactive visualizations and advanced statistical techniques. The primary dataset is sourced from Our World in Data, offering a comprehensive repository of global poverty metrics and related indicators.

## Conclusion
By exploring the intricacies of global poverty dynamics and income inequality, this report aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on poverty alleviation strategies and economic policies. Through rigorous analysis and insightful visualizations, it seeks to provide valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders invested in the pursuit of a more equitable world.
