## Questions 01: Who is Conquering Extreme Poverty in Various Global Regions Across Time? How does the distribution of wealth differ among various income groups?

### The Significance of the Question:

Understanding the decline or persistence of extreme poverty—living on less than \$2.15 daily—across regions, reflects our global and local successes or failures in economic development, welfare policies, and equality measures. It's about gauging the effectiveness of our collective efforts to uplift the most vulnerable.

The exploration of wealth distribution across societies facilitates the identification of the extent of inequality and its concentration across various income categories. This understanding is crucial for formulating targeted approaches to address inequality and foster economic equity, ensuring that the advantages of growth are distributed more equitably among the entire population.

### Dependency Columns:

For question 01 part 01 the dependent columns are **`country`**: To categorize data by world region, **`year`**: To analyze trends over time and **`headcount_ratio_international_povline`**: To identify the percentage of the population living below the international poverty line, indicative of extreme poverty levels.

For question 01 part 02 the dependent columns are **`gini`**: A metric used to quantify the level of income inequality within a nation. **`palma_ratio`** is a metric that measures inequality by dividing the proportion of gross national income held by the wealthiest 10% of the population by the share held by the lowest 40%. It provides a more targeted perspective on inequality and **`s80_s20_ratio`** the ratio of income distribution between the top 20% and bottom 20%, emphasising the differences between the highest and lowest income categories.

### Analysis Plan:

To solve the question part 01 we will be used the time series visualization techniques by using ggplot2. These plots will help to understand the changing percentages of the populations in extreme proverty with respect to world regions, years.

For the part 01 we will apply the ggridges package in R to generate a ridge plot. This methodology has the capability to visually represent the dispersion of the gini, palma_ratio, and s80_s20_ratio metrics among various income brackets, hence offering valuable insights on the distribution of wealth within societies. The application of the ridge plot facilitates the facilitation of comparing several distributions, rendering it well-suited for illustrating disparities in inequality.


## Question 02: How do the education, income inequality, and economic dynamics interact across different geographical and temporal scales, influenced by welfare types, international poverty lines.

### The Significance of the Question:

This question explores poverty, inequality, and economic dynamics across regions and timeframes, considering welfare types and education levels. By analyzing data on poverty metrics like headcount ratios and income gaps, alongside indicators such as GDP per capita and remittances, it seeks to understand the complex interplay of factors shaping global development. The inclusion of education levels adds to the analysis, highlighting the role of human capital in poverty alleviation. Through interactive visualizations and data-driven insights, this inquiry aims to inform targeted policies and interventions, ultimately fostering inclusive growth and improving well-being on a global scale.

### Dependency Columns:

country
year
poverty_headcount_ratio_international_povline
income_gap_ratio_international_povline
Gini_coefficient
Palma_ratio
GDP_per_capita_PPP
remittances
welfare_type
reporting_level
education_levels

### Analysis Plan:

The proposed analysis setup provides a comprehensive framework for exploring the complex interplay between poverty, inequality, and economic dynamics at both global and temporal scales. By leveraging interactive visualizations and advanced data querying capabilities, users can gain deep insights into the factors driving poverty and inequality trends, as well as assess the effectiveness of different welfare policies and international poverty interventions.

Visualizations: A dynamic 3D globe and Parallel Coordinates Plot (PCP) showcase poverty, inequality, and economic indicators across countries and time. Interactivity: Time-lapse controls and dynamic selection tools allow users to explore data trends and outliers. Insights: Users can uncover complex relationships and simulate scenarios to understand the impact of economic changes and policies on poverty and inequality.
