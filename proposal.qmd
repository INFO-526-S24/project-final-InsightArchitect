## Introduction

In the global mission to tackle poverty, having thorough and trustworthy data is absolutely essential. Our proposal centers around a dataset sourced from Our World in Data, focusing on global poverty trends. With a vast array of indicators spanning income, education, inequality, and welfare policies, this dataset serves as a crucial resource for researchers and policymakers alike. It enables a deeper understanding of the dynamics of poverty across various regions and time-frames, offering insights into the effectiveness of interventions and the distribution of wealth among different income groups.

## Why we are choosing this dataset?

This dataset offers extensive breadth and depth, providing a wealth of poverty-related metrics and variables. With its vast scope, there are abundant opportunities for analysis and exploration, making it an attractive choice for research and intervention purposes. Understanding poverty dynamics is crucial for informing evidence-based interventions aimed at reducing global poverty and fostering inclusive growth.

## Questions 01: Who is Conquering Extreme Poverty in Various Global Regions Across Time? How does the distribution of wealth differ among various income groups?

### The Significance of the Question

Understanding the decline or persistence of extreme poverty—living on less than \$2.15 daily—across regions, reflects our global and local successes or failures in economic development, welfare policies, and equality measures. It's about gauging the effectiveness of our collective efforts to uplift the most vulnerable.

The exploration of wealth distribution across societies facilitates the identification of the extent of inequality and its concentration across various income categories. This understanding is crucial for formulating targeted approaches to address inequality and foster economic equity, ensuring that the advantages of growth are distributed more equitably among the entire population.

### Analysis Plan

#### Plot 01 : Stacked Area Chart to know Poverty Trends:

A stacked area chart is an inventive method that may be used. This kind of graphic can show the `headcount_ratio_international_povline` over time for different areas as components of a whole. The data from each region is layered on top of one another, making it possible to see clearly how each region's proportion of the world's total headcount of extreme poverty has changed over time.

**Dependency Columns:**

For Plot 01 the dependent columns are **`country`**, **`year`** and **`headcount_ratio_international_povline`**.

**Visualization Descriptions:**

The cumulative percentage of the world's population living in extreme poverty would be represented by the y-axis, while time (years) would be represented by the x-axis. To facilitate easy differentiation, each region in the stack would be represented by a distinct color or pattern.With the help of this representation, we will be able to observe not only the general downward trend in extreme poverty over time, but also the contributions of various regions to these changes. For example, a region's area diminishing over time would be indicative of effective measures to reduce poverty in that region. With the use of the chart, policy measures can be focused and focused on reducing poverty by recognizing both global patterns and regional contributions to these trends.

#### Plot 02 : Ridge Plot for Wealth Distribution Analysis:

A 'Ridge Plot' is a great tool to compare the distribution of a continuous variable between groups; in this case, the distribution of wealth as determined by `s80_s20_ratio`, `gini`, and `palma_ratio` among different income groups. "Ridge plots" are just a set of vertically arranged, slightly overlapped density charts for every group. It is simpler to compare the distributions and see trends or outlines with this setup in place.

**Dependency Columns:**

For Plot 02 dependent columns are **`gini`**, **`palma_ratio`** and **`s80_s20_ratio`**

**Visualization Descriptions:**

Each ridge (or line) in the figure would indicate the distribution of one of the inequality metrics.\
Each ridge would be labeled with the income group it represents, and the metric value would be represented by the x-axis. It would be simpler to determine which income groups face the greatest inequality if we could see the distribution and central tendency of inequality metrics within each income group. We may determine whether higher income groups likely to have more or less inequality in comparison to lower income groups by analyzing the shapes and peaks of the ridges. A higher peak in the ridge for the top 20% of incomes than for the lowest 20%, for instance, would point to a larger concentration of wealth among the highest earners. The ridge plot can be used to guide policy toward more equitable economic distribution by illuminating the distribution of wealth and assisting in the understanding of not just the degree of inequality within each income group but also how these levels compare across groups.

## Question 02: How do the education, income inequality, and economic dynamics interact across different geographical and temporal scales, influenced by welfare types, international poverty lines.

### The Significance of the Question:

This question explores poverty, inequality, and economic dynamics across regions and timeframes, considering welfare types and education levels. By analyzing data on poverty metrics like headcount ratios and income gaps, alongside indicators such as GDP per capita and remittances, it seeks to understand the complex interplay of factors shaping global development. The inclusion of education levels adds to the analysis, highlighting the role of human capital in poverty alleviation. Through interactive visualizations and data-driven insights, this inquiry aims to inform targeted policies and interventions, ultimately fostering inclusive growth and improving well-being on a global scale.

### Dependency Columns:

These columns include 'country', 'year', 'poverty_headcount_ratio_international_povline', 'income_gap_ratio_international_povline', 'Gini_coefficient', 'Palma_ratio', 'GDP_per_capita_PPP', 'remittances', 'welfare_type', 'reporting_level', and 'education_levels'. By examining these variables, the analysis aims to shed light on how different factors such as welfare policies, economic performance, and educational attainment interact to shape the global landscape of poverty and economic inequality.

### Analysis Plan:

The proposed analysis setup provides a comprehensive framework for exploring the complex interplay between poverty, inequality, and economic dynamics at both global and temporal scales. By leveraging interactive visualizations and advanced data querying capabilities, users can gain deep insights into the factors driving poverty and inequality trends, as well as assess the effectiveness of different welfare policies and international poverty interventions.

For the Visualization part of the analysis, the plan includes:

1.  A dynamic 3D globe that visually represents poverty, inequality, and economic indicators across countries and over time, providing a global perspective on the data.

2.  Parallel Coordinates Plot (PCP) to showcase the complex relationships between different variables such as poverty rates, Gini coefficient, GDP per capita, and more, allowing for detailed analysis of trends and disparities.

3.  Interactivity features such as time-lapse controls and dynamic selection tools, which enable users to explore data trends, identify outliers, and understand the evolution of poverty and inequality over time.

4.  Insightful analyses and scenario simulations, helping users to uncover complex relationships between variables and assess the potential impact of economic changes, policy interventions, and educational improvements on poverty and inequality levels.
