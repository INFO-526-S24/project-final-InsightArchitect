## Justification of approach

## Questions 01: Who is Conquering Extreme Poverty in Various Global Regions Across Time? How does the distribution of wealth differ among various income groups?

### Plot 01 : Stacked Bar Chart to know Poverty Trends over the year in the World

#### **Dependency Columns:**

For Plot 01 dependent columns are `"Number.of.people.living.in.extreme.poverty"`, `"Number.of.people.not.living.in.extreme.poverty"` & `"year"`

```{r}

                      1870,

**Visualization Descriptions:**

The global population's historical data, from 1820 to 2017, is visualized as a bar chart that shows those living in and out of extreme poverty. It displays two segments: those living in extreme poverty are indicated in the top segment `(shown in red)`, while the people not living in extreme poverty is represented in the bottom segment `(shown in blue`). The blue segment shows a clear increase over time, indicating a decrease in extreme poverty rates and an increase in the population living above the poverty line. On the other hand, there is a good tendency toward the reduction of poverty as the red segment diminishes, which is particularly evident after 1980. The population counts in billions are provided by the text labels on each bar segment. The referenced data source, Ravallion (2016), has been updated with additional information including World Bank (2019) data.

### Plot 02 : Distribution of Wealth Inequality Across Different Income Groups

#### **Dependency Columns:**

For Plot 02 dependent columns are `"gini"`, `"palma_ratio"`, `"s80_s20_ratio"`, `"p90_p10_ratio"`, `"p90_p50_ratio"`, `"p50_p10_ratio"` and `"mld"`

#### Visualization Descriptions:

Less inequality is often suggested by higher values in the context of metrics such as the `Gini coefficient`, `Palma ratio`, or `S80/S20 ratio`, whereas more inequality is often suggested by lower values.

**Darker hues:** approaching the color purple, would symbolize a more equitable distribution, where income is dispersed more equally among the populace.

**Brighter hues:** which resemble yellow more closely, would be indicative of greater inequality and wealth concentration in a smaller number of hands. As an illustration, a country's level of inequality would be shown by a `Gini coefficient` that is closer to 0 (darker colors) or closer to 1 (brighter colors). In the same way, lower values for the `Palma` and `S80/S20 ratios` would indicate a narrower gap between the wealthiest and poorest groups in society.
