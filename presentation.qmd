# Global Poverty - Fact!

"According to the World Bank, the global extreme poverty rate fell to 9.2% in 2017, marking the first time in recorded history that less than 10% of the world population lived below the international poverty line of \$1.90 a day*.*"– World Bank Analyst

## Understanding the Project

-   <strong>Project Description</strong> - This project use the data-set from Our World in Data to analyze and visualize the dynamics and trends across different regions and timelines.

-   <strong>Expected Outputs</strong> - The project will produce an interactive data visualization using R and a shiny app - dashboard.

-   <strong>Significance of Project</strong> - By illustrating poverty trends, this project aims to aid researchers in designing effective poverty alleviation strategies, fostering global economic growth.

## Dataset Overview {.smaller}

-   The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset from [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/poverty) <strong>4,877 records and 108 metrics</strong> such as the headcount ratio, Gini coefficient, and other inequalitly indices.

-   Spans from <strong>1820 to the present</strong>, offering a historical perspective on poverty trends and economic changes over nearly 2 centuries

-   Covers over <strong>190 countries </strong>Enabling the study of poverty within varied economic, political, and cultural contexts

## Research Questions {.smaller}

<strong>Question 1</strong> : Dynamics of Poverty Reduction

-   Who is Conquering Extreme Poverty in Various Global Regions Across Time?

-   How does the distribution of wealth differ among various income groups?

## Visualization of Poverty Trends {.smaller}

## Description {.smaller}

-   The global population’s historical data, from 1820 to 2017, is visualized as a bar chart that shows those living in and out of extreme poverty.

-   It displays two segments: those living in extreme poverty are indicated in the top segment `(shown in red)`, while the people not living in extreme poverty is represented in the bottom segment `(shown in blue`).

-   The blue segment shows a clear increase over time, indicating a decrease in extreme poverty rates and an increase in the population living above the poverty line. On the other hand, there is a good tendency toward the reduction of poverty as the red segment diminishes, which is particularly evident after 1980.

-   The population counts in billions are provided by the text labels on each bar segment. The referenced data source, Ravallion (2016), has been updated with additional information including World Bank (2019) data.

## Distribution of Wealth Inequality {.smaller auto-animate="true"}

## Plot 2

![](images/animated_ridge_plot.gif){fig-align="center" width="604"}

## Description

-   **Darker hues:** approaching the color purple, would symbolize a more equitable distribution, where income is dispersed more equally among the populace.

-   **Brighter hues:** which resemble yellow more closely, would be indicative of greater inequality and wealth concentration in a smaller number of hands. As an illustration, a country's level of inequality would be shown by a `Gini coefficient` that is closer to 0 (darker colors) or closer to 1 (brighter colors).

-   In the same way, lower values for the `Palma` and `S80/S20 ratios` would indicate a narrower gap between the wealthiest and poorest groups in society.

## Research Question 2

<strong>Question 2</strong> : Impacts of Welfare Regimes on Poverty

-   How do welfare regimes and economic growth rates influence income inequality and poverty dynamics across different countries and continents over the last three decades, influenced by varying welfare types and international poverty lines?

-   what implications do these interactions have for future global poverty reduction strategies?

## Plot 3

## Description

-   Inequality Headcount using `gini`, `mean`, `median`

-   gini: How much the welfare is distributed among the nation

-   mean: What is the mean level of Income or expenditure overall

-   median: Level of income or expenditure where half the population live below the mean

-   Poverty Line: How many people are under poverty line - Heatmap

-   Palma Ratio: How much income is distributed between top 10% to bottom 40%

-   Head count ratio for income: How much percent of the nation population makes the given amount

# Wrap up {.smaller}

<strong>Summary of Findings</strong>

-   Our analysis reveals significant impacts of welfare regimes and economic growth on poverty dynamics and income inequality globally.

-   The role of diverse welfare systems in shaping economic outcomes was prominently evident across different regions and decades.

<strong>Future Research Directions</strong>

-   Future studies could explore the relationship between specific types of welfare policies and poverty reduction.

-   The insights from this study advocate for tailored welfare and economic policies that consider regional socio-economic dynamics.
