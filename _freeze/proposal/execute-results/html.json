How does the distribution of wealth differ among various income groups?\n\n### The Significance of the Question\n\nUnderstanding the decline or persistence of extreme poverty—living on less than \\$2.15 daily—across regions, reflects our global and local successes or failures in economic development, welfare policies, and equality measures. It's about gauging the effectiveness of our collective efforts to uplift the most vulnerable.\n\nThe exploration of wealth distribution across societies facilitates the identification of the extent of inequality and its concentration across various income categories. This understanding is crucial for formulating targeted approaches to address inequality and foster economic equity, ensuring that the advantages of growth are distributed more equitably among the entire population.\n\n### Analysis Plan\n\n#### Plot 01 : Stacked Area Chart to know Poverty Trends:\n\nA stacked area chart is an inventive method that may be used. This kind of graphic can show the `headcount_ratio_international_povline` over time for different areas as components of a whole. The data from each region is layered on top of one another, making it possible to see clearly how each region's proportion of the world's total headcount of extreme poverty has changed over time.\n\n**Dependency Columns:**\n\nFor Plot 01 the dependent columns are **`country`**, **`year`** and **`headcount_ratio_international_povline`**.\n\n**Visualization Descriptions:**\n\nThe cumulative percentage of the world's population living in extreme poverty would be represented by the y-axis, while time (years) would be represented by the x-axis. To facilitate easy differentiation, each region in the stack would be represented by a distinct color or pattern.With the help of this representation, we will be able to observe not only the general downward trend in extreme poverty over time, but also the contributions of various regions to these changes. For example, a region's area diminishing over time would be indicative of effective measures to reduce poverty in that region. With the use of the chart, policy measures can be focused and focused on reducing poverty by recognizing both global patterns and regional contributions to these trends.\n\n#### Plot 02 : Ridge Plot for Wealth Distribution Analysis:\n\nA 'Ridge Plot' is a great tool to compare the distribution of a continuous variable between groups; in this case, the distribution of wealth as determined by `s80_s20_ratio`, `gini`, and `palma_ratio` among different income groups. \"Ridge plots\" are just a set of vertically arranged, slightly overlapped density charts for every group. It is simpler to compare the distributions and see trends or outlines with this setup in place.\n\n**Dependency Columns:**\n\nFor Plot 02 dependent columns are **`gini`**, **`palma_ratio`** and **`s80_s20_ratio`**\n\n**Visualization Descriptions:**\n\nEach ridge (or line) in the figure would indicate the distribution of one of the inequality metrics.\\\nEach ridge would be labeled with the income group it represents, and the metric value would be represented by the x-axis. It would be simpler to determine which income groups face the greatest inequality if we could see the distribution and central tendency of inequality metrics within each income group. We may determine whether higher income groups likely to have more or less inequality in comparison to lower income groups by analyzing the shapes and peaks of the ridges. A higher peak in the ridge for the top 20% of incomes than for the lowest 20%, for instance, would point to a larger concentration of wealth among the highest earners. The ridge plot can be used to guide policy toward more equitable economic distribution by illuminating the distribution of wealth and assisting in the understanding of not just the degree of inequality within each income group but also how these levels compare across groups.\n\n## Question 02: How do welfare regimes and economic growth rates influence income inequality and poverty dynamics across different countries and continents over the last three decades, influenced by varying welfare types and international poverty lines, and what implications do these interactions have for future global poverty reduction strategies?\n\n### The Significance of the Question:\n\nWelfare Regimes and Economic Growth: This question focuses on the impact of different welfare types and economic growth on income inequality and poverty. It explores how these factors interact within different national and regional contexts.\n\nGeographical and Temporal Scales: The question retains its emphasis on exploring changes across different countries and continents over the past thirty years, providing a long-term perspective on trends and patterns.\n\nInfluence of Welfare Types and International Poverty Lines: By including welfare types and considering the role of international poverty lines (as standards for measuring poverty), this question aims to examine how different thresholds and welfare systems impact poverty measurements and perceptions.\n\nImplications for Poverty Reduction: It seeks to understand the effectiveness of various welfare and economic strategies in reducing poverty, aiming to inform future policy decisions.\n\n### Dependency Columns:\n\nThese columns include country, year: These attributes are foundational for any analysis that involves temporal and geographical comparisons.\nwelfare_type: Differentiates the types of welfare systems, which can have varying impacts on economic well-being and inequality.\nppp_version: Ensures that income and poverty metrics are comparable across different economic conditions globally.\nGini index, Palma ratio, S80/S20 ratio, P90/P10 ratio, P90/P50 ratio, P50/P10 ratio: These are critical for analyzing the extent and changes in income inequality.\n\n### Analysis Plan:\n\nThe proposed analysis setup provides a comprehensive framework for exploring the complex interplay between poverty, inequality, and economic dynamics at both global and temporal scales. By leveraging interactive visualizations and advanced data querying capabilities, users can gain deep insights into the factors driving poverty and inequality trends, as well as assess the effectiveness of different welfare policies and international poverty interventions.\n\nFor the Visualization part of the analysis, the plan includes:\n\nA dynamic 3D globe that visually represents poverty, inequality, and economic indicators across countries and over time, providing a global perspective on the data.\n\nVisualization for Interpretation and Presentation:\n\nGeographical Visualization: Use tools like Globe4r or rl package to create interactive maps that highlight income inequality and welfare types by location.\n\nInteractive Dashboards: Develop a Shiny app or use similar tools to create interactive visualizations that allow users to explore different dimensions of the data, such as toggling between different welfare regimes or time periods.\n\nDynamic Time-Series Visualizations: Implement line graphs that evolve over time to show trends in inequality indices for different countries or continents.\n\n\n<img src=\"images/Timeline_Insight_Architech.jpg\" alt=\"Timeline Image\" width=\"650\" height=\"550\">\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n### Workflow -
